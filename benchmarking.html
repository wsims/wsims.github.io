          <h3>Puppet Usability Benchmarking</h3>
          <div class="project-info project-challenge">
  			      <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                <p>Over the summer I worked as a UX intern at Puppet. Puppet is a company makes IT automation software for managing and securing your infrastructure.</p>
                <p>My main intern project was to develop and conduct a usability benchmarking study for measuring the ease of use of Puppet products.</p> </div>

          <div class="project-info project-role">
    			     <h4>Goals</h4>
    			        <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Research and develop a methodology for measuring the overall ease of use of Puppet Enterprise.</li>
                      <li>Measure the current usability of Puppet Enterprise to set a quantitative baseline for tracking the performance of each release.</li>
                      <li>Discover areas for improvement and specific usability issues through user testing.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Preliminary Research</h4>
            <p>Before I began developing a process to measure the overall ease of use of Puppet, I first researched common usability benchmarking practices and looked at what other companies have been doing in the industry. The metrics I chose were task completion rates, task times, errors and satisfaction because I felt they would give the best description of how well Puppet Enterprise provides value to the customer.</p>
            <p>These metrics were combined into a Single Usability Score (SUM) developed by Jeff Sauro. During my research, I found that companies such as AutoCAD and Adobe had success using SUM to benchmark their products and decided it would be a good fit for Puppet Enterprise.</p>
            <p>Initially, I had wanted to use path length as a core metric in measuring the usability of Puppet Enterprise. In practice, you would measure how the users chosen path to complete a task differs from the optimal path. I quickly realized that this would be extremely time consuming to record and would require video analysis after each test session. Path length is very closely correlated with time on task, so I decided to keep the original four metrics I had chosen.</p>
          <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <p><strong>Metrics:</strong> I used common usability metrics such as <strong>completion rates, task times, errors and satisfaction</strong> to measure the overall ease of use of Puppet Enterprise. Error scores were calculated by defining the number of error opportunities before each task and then comparing that value with the number of errors that occurred during testing. Satisfaction was measured using the Single Ease Question (SEQ) which is 7-point rating scale to assess how difficult users find a task. All of this metrics were combined into a single usability metric (SUM) score which was used to communicate overall performance.</p>
