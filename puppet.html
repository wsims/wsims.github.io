          <h3>Puppet Research Projects</h3>
          <p> During the Summer of 2016, I worked as a UX intern at <a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a>. Puppet is a company that makes IT automation software for managing and securing your infrastructure. As an intern, I facilitated over 30 usability test sessions and used a variety of different research methods. I conducted a heuristic evaluation, facilitated A/B testing of global search concepts, and evaluated various features through moderated usability testing. Due to my non-disclosure agreement, I can only share the results of features already released. Below is a case study on the usability of the Puppet Enterprise installer.
          <div class="project-info project-challenge">
  			      <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                <p>Improve the usability of the Puppet Enterprise installer by conducting usability test sessions with internal and external participants. I worked with a UX Designer on this project.</p> </div>

          <div class="project-info project-role">
    			     <h4>Goals</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Assess how well users are able to install in text-mode and recover from failed installations to meet product initiatives.</li>
                  <li>Find usability issues and areas for improvement to influence the future direction of the installer.</li>
                </ul>
          </div>
          <h4>Usability Issues</h4>
          <p>We selected three internal users for the first round of usability testing on the newest version of the Puppet Enterprise installer. To successfully install Puppet Enterprise, the user needs to set a console admin in the installer configuration file. Our findings showed that users were unaware they needed to set a password and the error message thrown was ineffective for troubleshooting the issue.</p>
          <p>All participants encountered the error message below which is displayed when there is a missing console admin password in the configuration file. Users interpreted the message as an issue with curly braces on line 33.</p>
          <img style='width: 75%; margin: auto; object-fit: contain' src="assets/installer1.png"/>
          <p>When participants reviewed the configuration file, they would ignore the “console_admin_password” field to focus on the formatting of line 33. The error message was ineffective at pointing the users towards the correct solution. Participants were unable to troubleshoot and complete installation without being prompted.</p>
          <img style='width: 55%; margin: auto; object-fit: contain' src="assets/installer2.png"/>
          <h4>Solutions</h4>
          <p>My findings showed that entering the admin password was an issue for all participants so changes should be made to make the process more obvious. This could be achieved either by using color to make the line more visible or a larger comment field. I also made the recommendation to update the error message so the user is notified of a missing console admin password. These findings resulted in the improved error message below.</p>
          <img style='width: 75%; margin: auto; object-fit: contain' src="assets/installer3.png"/>
          <p>We were able to test and validate this solution during the subsequent external usability test sessions with five active Puppet users from various organizations. Users were selected based on the type of installer they were using. We chose two Puppet open source users who have never used the official installer, and three who were actively using Puppet Enterprise. The improved error messaging caused participants to recover quickly and without prompting.</p>

          <p>However, the error still needed to be prevented in the first place. Based off my recommendations, a new design was implemented for increased visibility of the console admin password field that was validated during the installer portion of the <a href="/benchmarking.html">benchmarking</a> sessions. Overall, the goals for the study were met and users were successful at installing Puppet Enterprise.</p>

          <p>Thanks for reading. Other examples of my work can be found on my <a href="/normienotes.html">Normie Notes</a> and <a href="/benchmarking.html">Usability Benchmarking</a> pages.</p>
